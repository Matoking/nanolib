## [0.3]
### Added
 - Add support for Windows (x86 and x86-64) using the MSVC compiler.
 - Add support for Linux (ARM) using the GCC compiler.
 - Add support for the NEON instruction set on ARM for better performance when generating PoW.
 - Add `nanolib.accounts.validate_seed` function for validating seeds.
 - Add `nanolib.work.validate_difficulty`, `nanolib.work.get_work_value`, `nanolib.work.derive_work_difficulty` and `nanolib.work.derive_work_multiplier` functions to help with dynamic PoW difficulty.
 - Add `Block.difficulty` property to adjust the required work difficulty on a per-block basis.
 - Add `Block.work_value` property to get the value of the included work.

### Changed
 - Enable multithreading when generating PoW by releasing GIL.

### Fixed
 - Fix conversions between MILLINANO and MEGANANO units when using strings as denomination parameters.
 - Verify epoch V1 state blocks correctly. See [nanocurrency/nano-node#955](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/955) for details.

## [0.2] - 2019-03-07
### Added
 - `Block.has_valid_work` and `Block.has_valid_signature` properties are cached to prevent redundant work.

### Changed
 - PyPI package `pynanocurrency` and module `nanocurrency` have both been renamed to `nanolib`.
 - Improved performance when encoding or decoding account IDs.

### Fixed
 - Raise a `decimal.Inexact` exception when trying to convert amounts with higher precision than a single raw.
